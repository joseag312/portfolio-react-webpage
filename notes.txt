üìù Release Backlog
Same image width/height for all the images, multiple versions of them
We've proven the carousel can load from AWS, what about the stack part??
A lot of images still ship with /public would it be worthfile to fetch those from AWS?

Preload images for fast rendering
    Preload hero + project images.
    Add <link rel="preload"> or <link rel="prefetch"> in index.html.
    JS preloader for carousel / next slides (portfolio.json images).
    Lazy-load non-critical assets.

Fix mobile friendliness
    TopNav collapse + spacing.
    Hero text scaling (.hexagon-title and .hexagon-subtitle already have media queries in styles.css).
    Ensure grids (Row/Col in App.tsx) wrap correctly.
    Tap targets (icons in BottomNav.tsx).
