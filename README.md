# [Portfolio Webpage](https://ggworkz.co)

üñ•Ô∏è **Personal Portfolio Website**

Developer Portfolio page using React and Bootstrap front end technologies.
Hosted using AWS with Route53, Load Balancing, EC2 and S3.

**Designed as a portfolio piece to showcase software engineering best practices.**

## Portfolio Focus

This project was designed as a **demonstration of software engineering practices** applied to front-end development.

### Frontend Architecture

- **Component-Based Design**: Modular components using **TypeScript** allows for quick refactoring.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Content (JSON), layout (Sections), and visuals (SVG/Background) are decoupled.
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive styling on all components with adaptive sizing.

### Cloud Hosting

- **AWS EC2 Hosting**: Deployed behind an **Application Load Balancer** for reliability.
- **Route 53 DNS + HTTPS**: Route 53 with SSL/TLS termination handled through AWS ACM.
- **Secure & Resilient**: HTTPS enforced end-to-end with health checks through the load balancer.

### Software Engineering Practices

- **Data-Driven Design**: `portfolio.json` allows updates, configuration and extension without code changes.
- **Reusable Components**: Composition-first approach for sections, navbars, and project modules.
- **Clean File Structure**: Each feature encapsulated in its own component file for clarity.
- **Fast Iteration**: Integrated Bootstrap/React-Bootstrap for rapid layout while maintaining a custom aesthetic.
